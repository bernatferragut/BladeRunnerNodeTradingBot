> What is a 'Simple Moving Average - SMA'
Is an arithmetic moving average calculated by adding the 'closing price' of the security for a number of time periods and then dividing this total by numbers of time periods.

> Why SMA is so important?
Many Traders watch for short-term averages to cross above longer-term average to signal the beginning of an uptrend.

> Note
Short-term averages can act as levels of support when the price experiences a pullback.
